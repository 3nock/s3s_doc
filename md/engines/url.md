# URL Engine

## What is?

**URL -** Uniform Resource Locator, colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. 
A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. 
URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http/https) but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
