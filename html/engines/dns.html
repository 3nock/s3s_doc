<h2> What is? </h2>
The DNS Engine resolves targets into specified DNS Records.<br>
This Tool uses multiple threads as alocated by the user to perform enumeration on targets 
also support use of multiple nameservers as provided by the user or default list by s3s.<br><br>

Records Supported by DNS Engine:<br>
--> <b> A Records</b>: ipv4 address.<br>
--> <b> AAAA Records </b>: ipv6 address.<br>
--> <b> NS Records </b>: Nameservers records.<br>
--> <b> MX Records </b>: Mail Exchange records.<br>
--> <b> CNAME Records </b>: Canonical records.<br>
--> <b> TXT Records </b>: TXT Records.<br>
--> <b> SRV Records </b>: Service Records.<br><br>

NOTE:<br>
--> SOA and PTR DNS records are not supported for now.<br><br>

You can obtain Passive Domains/Hostnames from the <a href=../engines/osint.html>OSINT Engine</a> of Sub3 Suite

<h2> Features </h2>
1. Supports use of multiple nameservers.<br>
2. Supports A(ipv4), AAAA(ipv6), NS, MX, TXT, CNAME and SRV dns records lookups.<br>
3. Supports multiple Targets lookup in one scan.<br>
4. SRV wordlist is also provided and can be modified as per user's liking<br>

<h2> Input Output: </h2><br>
<b> Input: </b> Domain/Hostname<br>
<b> Output: </b> DNS Records: A,AAAA,NS,MX,SRV,TXT,CNAME,ANY

<h2> Scan Configuration values: </h2><br>

<b> Threads - </b> Number of threads to use for quering the targets. If number of threads is greater that the number of targets, then one thread per target will be used.
<b> Timeout - </b> Time for performing the lookup in milliseconds (terminates connection if timeout). It is advised for the timeout to be greater than 1000<br>
<b> No Duplicates - </b> Check to avoid duplicated results of the target<br>
<b> AutoSave To Project - </b> Sends the obtained results directly to the project explorer as the scan progresses<br><br>

<b> Nameservers - </b> - Nameservers to use for DNS lookup. You can choose; <br>
<b><i>single nameserver:</i></b> by checking the single nameserver radio-button and choose the nameserver in the combo-box<br>
<b><i>random nameserver:</i></b> by checking the random nameserver radio-button and Sub3 Suite will use its default set of nameservers, assigning them randomly<br>
<b><i>custom nameserver:</i></b> by checking the random nameserver radio-button and enter the ip addresses of the nameservers you want to use<br>

<h2> Usage & Examples</h2>

1. Choose the DNS Record you want to enumerate; <b>A,AAAA,NS,MX,CNAME,TXT,ANY,SRV</b> note that <b>ANY</b> and <b>SRV</b> Records can only be enumerated alone without other records checked<br><br>

 - The Actions on Results are accessible via the <b>Actions ></b> button and <b>Right-Click</b> on the Results. & are only active when the results are present<br>

1. <b> Clear: </b> Clears the results and the progress bar.<br>
2. <b> Expand & Collapse: </b> Expands the all areas of the result tree and Collapse all areas of the result tree respectively<br>
3. <b> Save: </b> Saves the obtained Results To a File. Saves in Json format<br>
4. <b> Copy: </b> Copies the results on the clipboard. Copies in Json format<br>
5. <b> Send To Project: </b> Sends the Obtained results to the project explorer.<br>
5. <b> Send * To *: </b> Sends the Result Type to the choosen Engine/Enumerator.<br><br>

<b> NOTE: </b><br>
	If you have filtered the results using the filter. the above actions will only be performed on the remaing results after filter<br>
